It is an iOS game developed using Swift and Xcode.
Developed with the UIKit library,
my game manages visual elements and user interactions using UIImageView,
UILabel and UITapGestureRecognizer components. 
Timers control the game duration and the frequency with which moles appear,
UserDefaults saves the high score. The main functions include viewDidLoad() which initializes the game,
increaseScore() which increases the score, 
hideMole() which randomizes the mole display and countDown() which manages the game duration.
